    "Usually, when you run a circuit on a QPU, behind the scenes, Amazon Braket will do a series of compilation steps to optimize your circuit and map the abstract circuit to the physical qubits on the QPU. However, in many situations,  such as for error mitigation or benchmarking experiments, researchers require full control of the qubits and the gates that are being applied. In a [previous notebook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/braket_features/Allocating_Qubits_on_QPU_Devices.ipynb), we showed you how to manually allocate the qubits of your circuit, i.e., how you can exactly define which logical qubit maps to which physical qubit. In this notebook, you will learn how to use _verbatim compilation_ to run your circuits exactly as defined without any modification during the compilation process.\n",
